            our
            sites and provide you the most user-friendly experience.<br /><br /> All required information is service
            dependent and we may use the above said user information to, maintain, protect, and improve its services
            (including advertising services) and for developing new services<br /><br /> Such information will not be
            considered as sensitive if it is freely available and accessible in the public domain or is furnished under
            the
            Right to Information Act, 2005 or any other law for the time being in
            force.<br /><br /><strong>COOKIES</strong><br /> To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users,
            we
            may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique,
            random
            number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified
            Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way
            of
            knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can
            contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A
            cookie
            cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if
            you
            click on their ads), a process that we do not control.&nbsp;<br /><br /> Our web servers automatically
            collect
            limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you
            visit
            our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you
            data
            -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this
            information to
            deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure
            traffic
            within our site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LINKS TO THE OTHER SITES</strong><br /> Our policy discloses the privacy practices for our own web
            site
            only. Our site provides links to other websites also that are beyond our control. We shall in no way be
            responsible in way for your use of such sites.<strong>5. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>INFORMATION SHARING</strong><br /> We shares the sensitive personal information to any third party
            without obtaining the prior consent of the user in the following limited
            circumstances:<br /><br /><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;When it is requested or required by law or by any court
            or
            governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or for the
            prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of
            offences.
            These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for
            enforcing
            these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and
            regulations.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;We proposes to share such information within its
            group
            companies and officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing personal
            information
            on its behalf. We also ensure that these recipients of such information agree to process such information
            based
            on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and
            security measures.<br /><br /><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY</strong><br /> We take appropriate security
            measures
            to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
            These
            include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
            including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to
            systems
            where we store personal data.<br /><br /> All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within
            our
            controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is
            password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security
            system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that
            information
            you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any
            information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet
            access.&nbsp;<br /><br /> However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy
            from
            time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will
            always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new
            policy may be.&nbsp;</p>
